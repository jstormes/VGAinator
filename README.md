Experiments with TTL VGA circuitry, from a coders perspective


At this point I have some KiCad designs for a timing circuit that can generate some VGA sync signals.

The end goal is a circuit that can be easily added to an 8 bit processor like a z80 or 6502 to give it a graphical
output without too much effort.  

The C code in this project is currently used to generate the "microcode" for the timing circuit.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/jstormes/VGAinator/wiki) for more detail.
